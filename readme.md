# OpenAI Poem Generator

The poem generator was mostly generated with the help of responses by ChatGPT.

The chat is available here: [Create Poem Generator](https://chat.openai.com/share/2e23f875-6362-4fa6-bd48-5d47d4a2abf0).

Run command for development: `uvicorn main:app --reload`.

The application has been deployed to https://versify.fly.dev/.

The development was started, but not finished at the AI Hackathon at [Team-Rockstars-IT](https://github.com/Team-Rockstars-IT/Hackathon-AI).
